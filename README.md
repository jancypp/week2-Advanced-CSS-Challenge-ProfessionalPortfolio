# week2-Advance-CSS-Challenge-Professional Portfolio

# Description
This project was to practice our skills in CSS and to create a web application from scratch that showcases our professional portfolio.

The portfolio will provide the necessary information employers are looking for when filling positions including contact information, my body of work during this course, etc. For now some of the content will be placeholders but we will go back and add links to our webpages as the course progresses.

# Instructions

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
